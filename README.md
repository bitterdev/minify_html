# Minify HTML

Minify HTML is a lightweight and efficient Concrete CMS add-on that automatically minimizes the HTML output of your website by removing unnecessary whitespace, line breaks, and comments—without affecting the appearance or functionality of your pages.

This add-on is a modern continuation of the original HTML Minify add-on developed by A3020, which was discontinued over four years ago. Minify HTML builds upon that foundation with a fully refactored codebase, offering improved performance, better compatibility with current Concrete CMS versions, and ongoing maintenance.

Minify HTML integrates seamlessly into Concrete CMS and works smoothly with the platform’s caching and rendering systems. It’s an ideal solution for developers and site owners looking to boost page speed, optimize SEO, and deliver clean, compressed HTML—effortlessly.
